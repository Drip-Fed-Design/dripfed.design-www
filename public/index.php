                            <p>But before jumping on that ship, consider the time and money you'll spent, recruiting in a hope to find the right designer, with experience.</p>
                            <p>Then weigh up the average salary of that full-time senior product designer, currently excess of £72k. Then stacked on top of that, you'll have pensions, bonuses, company NI, and other benefits (e.g. company car, gym membership, healthcare, etc).</p>
                            <p>In comparison, our monthly subscription would cost you at most £47,520 per year- that's an instant saving of £24,480!</p>
                            <p>And you're not even locked-in... SH*T!!</p>
                            <p>Finally, with a cherry on top, you'll have an added load of keeping that employee busy to gain your ROI. Unable to put their wage on pause for a month or two if things get a little quiet- unlike our design subscription, which you can cancel at anything.</p>
                            <p>We're here for individuals, startups, enterprises, and teams with a continuing need for design and growth.</p>

                            <p>Honestly, it depends on the complexity of the task.</p>
                            <p>When a request has been submitted, we will review it within 2 hours, giving it a complexity score and assign a realistic deadline.</p>
                            <p>Most common design requests are completed within 3 working days, or less.</p>
                            <p>More complex task or project requests can take slightly longer to receive an initial draft. But generally this is within 7 working days. Our general complexity scoring levels are as follows;</p>
                            <p>- <strong>Low:</strong> Within 3 working days, or less.</p>
                            <p>- <strong>Medium:</strong> Within 5 working days, or less.</p>
                            <p>- <strong>High:</strong> Within 10 working days, or less.</p>
                            <p>Everything we create will be original and of very high quality, created from a blank canvas with all your requirements, goals, and end user in mind.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, don't forget you'll be provided with progress updates throughout every task and project stage, proactively, with potential realtime design access.</p>

                            <p>It's easy. We'll provide you access to a billing portal, powered by Stripe- for reassurance that everything is safe and secure!</p>
                            <p>Within the portal, you'll be able to cancel or upgrade your subscription at any time. This means if you enter a dry spell, you can cancel (put on hold) your subscription until things pick up again. Super easy!</p>
                            <p>It's worth remembering subscriptions are paid upfront. Therefore, if you decide to cancel 10 days after your renewal, you'll still receive the same quality service for the remainder of the month.</p>
                            <p>Please be conscious that an active subscription is required for us to work through your requests. If your subscription cycle unfortunately ends while you still have requests in queue, these requests will be put on hold.</p>

                            <p>But for guidance, some clients tend to cancel subscriptions ahead of quiet periods or project budgets being confirmed. These cancelled periods tend to only last for a month or two.</p>
                            <p>As for indefinite cancellations, you should only proceed if you're certain our services are no longer required. If you decide to take this route, your Wrike account setup and all contained data will be removed after 3 months from your date of indefinite cancellation.</p>

A home for all kinds of documents, files, images, and spreadsheets- it makes everything so easy to find.</p>

                            <p>This means we will not only design that dreamy landing page or dashboard interface, but also take it all the way through to building a host-able package of code.</p>
                            <p>Just keep in mind that web development tend to take longer than design, approximately x3 the duration. Therefore the delivery timescales for the development work would increase. But, this depends on project complexity, which I'm sure you understand.</p>
