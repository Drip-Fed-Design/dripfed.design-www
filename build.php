                <p>Drip Fed Design works in a similar way to a Netflix or Apple TV+ subscription. Subscribe for a single fixed monthly fee and consume as much as you can.</p>
                <p> This enables any business, whatever the size, to access an unlimited drip of quality design, with each request completed one by one, in date ascending order (oldest first).</p>
                <p>E.g. Startup need branding or MVP. Enterprise running a marketing campaign over the next six-month...</p>
                <p>The easy opt-in which supports the scale of your business. A design as a service subscription make everything so much simpler.</p>

                <h2>WHY a subscription?</h2>
                <p>Drip Fed Design holds a unique position. We bridge the gap between a freelancer and a fixed-term contractor with open ended unlimited design subscription plans.</p>
                <p>Our plans allow the ease and flexibility of a freelancer, but without the complex lock-in which comes with fixed-term contracts and permanent employment. You'll get the best of both worlds.</p>
                <p>Cancel or pause any time, no long-term contracts to lock you in. Simple, straightforward, and fair, just great design delivered as it should be.</p>

                            <p>You could... if it's the right fit for you.</p>
                            <p>But before jumping on that ship, consider the time and money you'll spent, recruiting in a hope to find the right designer, with experience.</p>
                            <p>Also weigh up the average salary of that full-time senior product designer, currently excess of Â£72k. Then stacked on top of that, you'll have pensions, bonuses, company NI, and other benefits (e.g. company car, gym membership, healthcare, etc).</p>
                            <p>In comparison, our monthly subscription would cost you at most Â£47,520 per year- that's an instant saving of Â£24,480!</p>
                            <p>And you're not even locked-in... SH*T!!</p>
                            <p>Finally, with a cherry on top, you'll have an added load of keeping that employee busy to gain your ROI. Unable to put their wage on pause for a month or two if things get a little quiet- unlike our design subscription.</p>
                            <p>We're here for individuals, startups, enterprises, and teams with a continuing need for design and growth.</p>

                            <p>Honestly, it depends on the complexity of the task.</p>
                            <p>When a request has been submitted, we will review it within an a few hours after receiving, give it a complexity score and assign a realistic deadline.</p>
                            <p>Most common requests are completed within 3 working days, or less.</p>
                            <p>More complex task or project requests can take slightly longer to receive an initial draft. But generally this is within 7 working days. Our general complexity scoring levels are as follows;</p>
                            <p><strong>Low:</strong> Within 3 working days, or less.</p>
                            <p><strong>Medium:</strong> Within 5 working days, or less.</p>
                            <p><strong>High:</strong> Within 10 working days, or less.</p>
                            <p>Everything we create will be original and of very high quality, created from a blank canvas with all your requirements and goals in mind.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore, don't forget you'll be provided with progress updates throughout every task and project stage, with potential realtime design access.</p>

                            <p>It's easy. We'll provide you access to a billing portal, powered by Stripe- for reassurance that everything is safe and secure!</p>
                            <p>Within the portal, you'll be able to pause, cancel or upgrade your subscription at any time. This means if you enter a dry spell, you can pause your subscription until things pick up again. Super easy!</p>
                            <p>It's worth remembering subscriptions are paid upfront. Therefore, if you pause or cancel 10 days after your monthly renewal, you'll still receive the same quality service for the remainder of the current cycle. The service will switch over to a paused state at the end of the current cycle.</p>
                            <p>Please also be conscious that an active subscription is required for us to work through your requests. For example, if your subscription cycle ends while you still have requests in queue, these requests will be paused.</p>

                            <p>To be honest, it's totally up to you.</p>
                            <p>But for guidance, some clients pause subscriptions ahead of quiet periods or project budgets being confirmed. Pauses period tend to only last for a month or two.</p>
                            <p>As for subscription cancellations, you should only proceed if you're certain our services are no longer required. If you decide to cancel, your Wrike setup and all contained data will be removed after 6 months from your date of cancellation.</p>
