        <p>We reserve the right to refuse sale for any form of Project or Service from suspect payment or address details, or other reason at our discretion. We reserve the right without notice to cancel, reject, refuse sale to or work with a Client without reason for such rejection or refusal.</p>

        <h3>Returns and Refunds</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to deny refunds based on its own self discretion and without notice or liability to Client. Refund requests are assessed on a case by case basis. Should Client request a refund with valid reasoning during the first month of valid subscription, all materials produced by us are ownership of the company and are prohibited from being used by the Client in any way.</p>
        <p>If a refund is deemed to be appropriate, there will be a one-off fee of £599 assigned to the remaining billable period.</p>

        <h3>Domain Names & Hosting</h3>
        <p>The Client agrees to take all legal responsibility for use of third-party domain name, hosting and email services and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claim resulting from the Client publication of material and use of the domain name, hosting, and email services.</p>
        <p>Any support or payment due relating to the domain name, hosting and email services are to be made between the Client and the third-party service, unless stated otherwise in writing that we offered to purchase and set up the domain name, hosting and email services for the Client, and will therefore invoice the final cost, including a setup fee to Client.</p>
        <p>The Client agrees to pass on (S)FTP details and any other access details relating to their domain name, hosting, or email account which we require to undertake work for a Project or Service.

        <p>In the event that the Client's website fails or becomes corrupt for any reason that has Client origin, a one-off fee of £399 will be invoiced to complete the backup restoration, if third-party backups are available. The Client understands and agrees that if a full data restoration is requested and implemented, all current website data will be removed and replaced by the backup restoration data, and that this process cannot be undone.</p>

        <h3>Projects, Services and Support</h3>
        <p>All requests, alterations and support which relate to a Project or Service are to be requested in writing by email or Wrike by the Client.</p>
        <p>After the specified allocated time of alterations or support at stated within the quotation, proposal or invoice have been completed, we reserve the right to advise the Client as such and send a separate quotation, proposal, or invoice to the Client and to request payment for any further alterations. We reserve the right to request payment be received for further alterations and support before continuing work, unless the client has a valid and active subscription.</p>
        <p>Upon completion of a Project or Service, the Client is asked to confirm in writing by email or Wrike that the Project or Service is signed off as complete and agree that any further alterations and support may be chargeable, unless the client has a valid and active subscription.</p>
        <p>The Client agrees to provide any needed information and content we require in good time to enable us to complete the Project or Service as part of an agreed allocation of time and cost.</p>
        <p>The Client agrees that the Project or Service completed, such as but not limited to development services. may not exactly match the original designs provided because of the difference between the display in design software, internet browser, colouring of device display, printing technique or print materials. We agree to try and match the agreed concepts as closely as we possibly can.</p>
        <p>If an error or issue with the Project or Service arises which does not allow the Project or Service to match the original specification, then Client agrees that we can apply a nearest available alternative solution, with an agreed allocation of time and cost.</p>
        <p>After the Project or Service completion, a Client or a third-party of their choosing may wish to edit the Project or Service themselves to make updates. However, the Client agrees that in so doing they assume full responsibility for any issues which occur as a result of changing the Project or Service themselves. If Client or a third-party of their choosing edits the Project or Service and this results in functionality errors or the Project or Service displaying incorrectly, then we reserve the right to quote or invoice for work to repair the Project or Service back to its original formality.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to assign subcontractors in whole or as part of a Project or Service if needed. All communications between us and Client shall be by email, Wrike, WhatsApp, or in person, except were agreed at our discretion.</p>
        <p>If a Client does not use all support hours stated within a proposal or contract for that period of the Project or Service, remaining un-used hours will not be carried forward to the following year or contract.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to deactivate a single, or multiple additional online services if no additional service contract is agreed between the Client and us for a 2-month period since the ending of a previous contract. Services include but are not limited to; websites, Wrike, portals, PWAs, or any other online hosted service or third-party. We agree to not take this action on any third-party services which is under the sole responsibility of the Client, such as a Clients direct contract between a third-party hosting provider.</p>
        <p><strong>Our design subscription services are exempt from the alteration and support limitations outlined above, only if a valid and paid in full subscription is in effect.</strong></p>
        <p>Within the period of that a Client has a valid and paid subscription, we reserve the right to propose a fair and proper timescale for us to complete each Project or Service request. The Client must recognise and accept that each Project or Service request submitted will be processed, actioned, completed and delivered one-by-one, or two-by-two, depending on the level of valid subscription, in date ascending order (oldest first).</p>
        <p>The client can prioritise a Project or Service request by written agreement by email, Wrike, or WhatsApp.</p>
        <p>The timescales that we allocate to each and every Project or Service request, will be from our professional and expert opinion, to ensure we provide the Client with the highest available standards of Project or Service delivery.</p>
        
        <h3>Third-Party Fonts</h3>
