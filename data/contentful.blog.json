        "articleBody": "<p>I know, right. McDonald&#039;s has been running their iconic Monopoly marketing campaign for 18 long years. Although, it doesn&#039;t feel like that many years, does it. It kind of feels like having a kid, blinking, and they are now turning into an adult.<\/p><p>For 2024, <a href=\"https:\/\/monopoly.mcdonalds.co.uk\/\" title=\"\">McDonald&#039;s and MONOPOLY have supercharged the campaign<\/a> - by introducing &quot;Power Peel&quot;. Power Peel adds to the mouth watering campaign success by empower us (the consumer) to use our fingers to unlock more ways to win over 70 million prizes. And the prize pool is not all about McDonald&#039;s, they do subtly nod to MONOPOLY, with prizes like &#039;Train&#039; credit and &lsquo;Free Parking&rsquo;.<\/p><p>Building on what their consumers love most: the PEEL, the peel-on-pack element remains, offering a chance to reveal a property or an instant win.<\/p><p>But it doesn&#039;t end there! Oh no.<\/p><p>The fun continues within the McDonald&rsquo;s mobile app, where players peel, scan, and collect property codes, where they can complete their sets to win prizes. When a consumer banks a property in the app, they&rsquo;re given another chance to win through an extra in-app &#039;Digital Peel&#039;. An awesome way to seamlessly connect, and continue, both physical and digital consumer engagement for the brands. (Well done to the strategy team on that one!)<\/p><p>You&#039;ve just got to &quot;Peel on pack, make moves in App&quot;.<\/p><h2>Visualising the end-to-end mechanic lifecycle of a playing consumer<\/h2><p>There are a total of 4 ways your can play the MONOPOLY campaign, as outlined in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mcdonalds.com\/gb\/en-gb\/terms-and-conditions\/monopoly-consumer-rules-2024.html\" title=\"\">rules and terms<\/a>. Each of the following games can be played this year:<\/p><ol><li><p><a href=\"https:\/\/monopoly.mcdonalds.co.uk\/prizes#tabcontent-2\" title=\"\">Instant Win Game<\/a> for the chance to get a Game Piece awarding one of the prizes from the Instant Win range.<\/p><\/li><li><p><a href=\"https:\/\/monopoly.mcdonalds.co.uk\/prizes#tabcontent-1\" title=\"\">Collect to Win Game<\/a> for the chance to collect complete MONOPOLY Property Sets to win prizes from the Collect to Win prize-range, with each type of set offering its own prize-type once completed.<\/p><\/li><li><p><a href=\"https:\/\/monopoly.mcdonalds.co.uk\/prizes#tabcontent-3\" title=\"\">Digital Peel Game<\/a> for the chance to enter a digital, winning-moments game for an award of a prize or reward from the digital Peel range (including the Mayfair Monday game mechanic which is new for 2024).\n\nThese are the possible instant notification when playing Digital Peel Game:<\/p><ol><li><p><em>Cash Peel: a cash prize between &pound;5 and &pound;100.<\/em><\/p><\/li><li><p><em>Community Chest Peel: a non-cash prize from merchandise, food prizes and offers, MyMcDonald&rsquo;s Rewards points to rare Properties, as detailed in the prize-table in the <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/mcdrules.co.uk\/\" title=\"\"><em>Rules<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p><\/li><li><p><em>Bank or Swap Peel: award of a commonly found Property.

Oh, and you can only play the Mr Monopoly Bonus Reward game mechanic once throughout the whole campaign.<\/p><p>To help visualise this, I&rsquo;ve scribbled down some drawings of the players lifecycle.<\/p><div>Asset#qQAFpy65pVHWTNyIG4GAd<\/div><h2>Consumer facing design and User Experience (UX)<\/h2><p>Starting with the campaign&#039;s key visual. It clearly has a bold and vibrant new neon and &quot;peel back&quot; style. The typography is strong, but with variation. The red and yellow colours are defiantly on-brand, complimenting both McDonald&rsquo;s and MONOPOLY&rsquo;s similar red and yellow.<\/p><div>Asset#4hJXaivHVWhyHEvEFmsZGT<\/div><p>But... (there is always a but... but not always bad) compared to previous years, the creatives decided to take a more punchy approach for the colour palette. More Virginia Avenue, States Avenue, and St. Charles Place. Less of the historic blue&#039;ie feel of the campaign&#039;s key visual, and way, way, more pink - which I really like!<\/p><div>Asset#5wiUbsE29kl0z3UOhTCIlW<\/div><p>As for the mobile app, the campaign leverages the official McDonald&rsquo;s U.K app, which means it has nothing <em>really<\/em> to do with, or related to, Hasbro&#039;s Monopoly. For the digital winning mechanics, it looks like the tms digital team have built and embedded an app-separate web experience into a modal body, within the mobile app. Which I fully support, as this keeps the consumers digital experience within the fortress of user sessions and authentication, minimising the risk of promo compers and those who want to try and manipulate the system.<\/p><p>I did find myself opening the experience on my laptop (outside of the app \ud83d\ude48) and digging around the tmsiwin source code to see how the front-end was built. Needless to say, the tms team had used an array of familiar technologies, such as Cloudflare, Vue, GSAP, PixiJS, Google Fonts, Piwik Pro Analytics (etc). AND, it&#039;s all packaged in under 6.5MB of resource. Kudos!<\/p><p>The layout of the mobile experience has been structured in a format that I would have expected to see. It&#039;s strong and clear, with primary navigation at the bottom of the page and secondary at the top right side. Perfect for the thumb zone, if you hold you mobile with your right hand.<\/p><div>Asset#2zRowk2mJ24v2v8R9220tA<\/div><div>Asset#MQNPqBDTZWPczKPgbYQ4t<\/div><p>The mobile design has not been made overly complicated, which is a positive to see. But, in my opinion, it does lack <em>some<\/em> button prioritisation as a minor point, and colour contrasts for visual accessibility. Especially when you consider that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/forecasts\/1335605\/mcdonalds-restaurant-chains-brand-profile-in-the-uk\" title=\"\">brand awareness of McDonald&rsquo;s<\/a> in the UK sits at 96%, with approximately 43.5 million UK consumers.<\/p><p>For any brand, that&#039;s a LOT of eyes!<\/p><p>I would also question some of the copy placement, for example, the notice which tells consumers to keep hold of their games pieces. From my experience designing consumer facing entry campaign for the likes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chriswatterston.com\/work\/case-study\/lucozade-energy-xbox-halo-drink-campaign?utm_source=dripfed&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=mcdonaldsmonopoly\" title=\"\">Lucozade Halo<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chriswatterston.com\/work\/case-study\/ribena-hasbro-games-fmcg-drink-campaign?utm_source=dripfed&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=mcdonaldsmonopoly\" title=\"\">Ribena Hasbro<\/a>, this should defiantly be at the top of the page, above the &lsquo;Digital Peel unlocked&rsquo; card. This is a vital bit of information which could make or <u>break<\/u> a consumers ability to claim their prize!!<\/p><div>Asset#2YihuhL1NZQpZMpyV7q0kp<\/div><p>On a final note, it&rsquo;s defiantly worth highlighting the very noticeable in-app colour changes when we wake-up on a Mayfair Monday (Oh, hello blue). It creates a strong contrast on the &lsquo;Scan&rsquo; button. Really nice!<\/p><div>Asset#9VV9IQyPYUz43emR8rIPV<\/div><h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2><p>My short though of it... I LOVE IT! The campaign has been sparked from the obvious pre-successor, but for me, this still beats the rest. I briefly remember my first McDonald MONOPOLY experience, when you only had to be aged 16 or over, and there was no mobile app... the good old days.<\/p><p>The 2024 digital user experience for this campaign has been executed brilliantly, <em>with some minor recommendation for certain item placements<\/em>. The consumer journey is clear, persist, and doesn&#039;t create any blockers when transitioning into the digital space. With a campaign of this size, it&#039;s safe to say the expectation from the target audience having a smartphone for app access, is off the table. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uswitch.com\/mobiles\/studies\/mobile-statistics\/\" title=\"\">As of 2023 in the UK, 98% of those aged 16-24 have a smartphone, and 86% of those aged 55-64<\/a>.<\/p><div>Asset#7b7h9O4BDe928zp7IyBawj<\/div><p>This McDonald&#039;s MONOPOLY promotion launched on Wednesday 4th September, and is running for six weeks - ending 15th October 2024. Although to play, you must be aged 18 or over. Which yes, the age requirement can be a head scratcher for most, but if you take the laws around promotions, sweepstakes, gambling, contracts, and marketing\/consumer protection, it makes perfect sense.<\/p><p>So, sorry kids (unless, it&#039;s your 18th birthday).<\/p><p>Check out the TV advert \ud83d\udc47<\/p><p>[youtube-start:nVUpnl0HHrM:youtube-end]<\/p><hr \/><h4>Want to learn more or need support?<\/h4><p>We know <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=whathowfuture\" title=\"\">Design Subscriptions<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=whathowfuture\" title=\"\">Design as a Service<\/a> may be new to most, we understand.

        "articleBody": "<p>Design for this... you&rsquo;re burnt out and in desperate need of a holiday. Sounds great, right?<\/p><p>You crave a week in the sun, away from everyday life. Bottomless refreshing drinks and a worry not in sight. Your booking options?<\/p><ol><li><p>Open Airbnb and filter by Beachfront.<\/p><\/li><li><p>Search for an all-inclusive package holiday.<\/p><\/li><\/ol><p>The Airbnb could allow for more privacy and a bigger space. But you&#039;d need to do food shopping, find good places to eat out, and role play your own bartender.<\/p><p>On the other hand, an all-inclusive would be effortless \ud83d\ude4c. Simply pay the cost, and then relax for a week of pampering.<\/p><p>It&#039;s decided! You make your choice and book the holiday... <strong><em>which option did you take?<\/em><\/strong><\/p><p>Let&#039;s briefly touch on something that sparks everyone&rsquo;s interest. Why spending money is painful, and how businesses can use design to heighten a buyer&rsquo;s experience?<\/p><h2>The science behind the pain<\/h2><p>Every time we spend our hard-earned money, we feel a small stab of pain. Why? Because even if we&#039;re 100% sure about our intentions, a part of our brain wired for loss aversion starts&nbsp;launches fireworks.<\/p><blockquote><p><em>What is Loss Aversion?<\/em><\/p><p><em>Loss aversion is that feeling when losing something hurts more than gaining something good feels.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p>But, what&#039;s interesting, is that this feeling gets increased when we spend directly, such as cash or debit card vs. using a credit card.<\/p><p>MIT studied 64 students placing bids on baseball cards. The results showed that students <a href=\"https:\/\/www.richardshotton.com\/the-choice-factory\" title=\"\">paying with a credit card would bid more than double ($61) vs. students using cash ($29)<\/a>.<\/p><p>So, when we book an all-inclusive holiday, we&#039;re dipping into our hard-earned money once. Likely weeks or months in advance of departing, meaning we only go through the pain of paying once.<\/p><p>Every visit to the bar for a refreshing drink, or food at the buffet, we get to feel the excitement of the experience without the emotional pain of paying.<\/p><p>Instead of getting loss pains the entire trip, we feel like royalty! And this is exactly the experience we want to create for our buyers, right?<\/p><h2>Inside a customer&rsquo;s mind<\/h2><p>Research shows that people judge an experience on what behavioural scientists call the Peak-End Theory.<\/p><blockquote><p><em>What is Peak-End Theory?<\/em><\/p><p><em>Peak-End Theory says we remember experiences mostly by how they were at the most intense moment and how they ended, not the whole thing.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Even if the whole experience was fantastic. For example, enjoying a meal at a Micheline Star restaurant, but then having to pay a huge bill at the end, will leave a bitter aftertaste.<\/p><p>When we pay for a product, as excited as we are, the loss aversion part of our brain starts launching fireworks when it&#039;s time to pay.<\/p><p>To launch less fireworks, we need to design a buying journey that makes customers feel less pain each time they buy our product.<\/p><h2>How can businesses apply this?<\/h2><p>There are a few ways we can apply this to a business, and they will seem obvious when we share them. You will have probably come across them before. Let&#039;s start...<\/p><h3>Bitesize payments<\/h3><p>Products with big price tag can come with less pain when split into multiple payments. This will reduce a buyers loss aversion, reducing the size of the fireworks.<\/p><p>Airbnb, Apple, and Cazoo offer financing options to make purchasing less painful and numb the loss aversion impact.<\/p><div>Asset#5t1M3wiuO557NCSpmCm9J6<\/div><h3>Free gift or incentive<\/h3><p>If a business offers subscriptions, and a customer cancels, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they no longer love the product. They likely just had other priorities that month for their hard-earned money.<\/p><p>Offering past customers an incentive or free gift if they resubscribe can win them back. Oh, and because their credit card will already be on file, we can optimise the whole checkout process, reducing the pay pain.<\/p><p>Or, what about creating a free course or eBook which provides value to a customer. Giving this out to both current and past subscribers, is a great way to earn trust and build demand for a product.<\/p><div>Asset#gWPVMAIH6XygRmFZCZkeN<\/div><h3>Gamified payment<\/h3><p>When we have fun, our bodies release a cocktail of neurotransmitters and hormones. These contribute to the feeling of happiness and well-being.<\/p><p>So, when a business understands and prioritises customer fun, like a casinos or Disneyland, this feeling can play a part in blocking out pay pain. They achieve this by encourage guests to pay with chips or a pre-paid MagicBand.<\/p><p>Yes, losing poker chips still hurts, but it&rsquo;s less painful than losing physical cash. Also, there is something about using a bracelet that doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>feel&nbsp;<\/em>like paying, therefore reducing loss aversion. This allows visitors to stay in a magical moment, rather than stressing about every purchase.<\/p><h3>Pay in advance!<\/h3><p>Many service businesses charge customers after the work has been complete, which ends an experience with a pay pain.<\/p><p>Alternatively, ask for payment in advance. This moves the pay pain to the beginning of their experience, giving the opportunity to end a service on a high. This plays in favour of the Peak-End theory.<\/p><h2>The breakdown<\/h2><p>So, we now know that loss aversion is a buyer&rsquo;s reality, and the Peak-End theory is something businesses should remember... pun intended!<\/p><p>But even exciting purchases can be slightly diminished when it&rsquo;s time to pay. Be purposeful when designing a buying experience. Make your customers feel less loss aversion and ensure the joys are remembered from their purchase.<\/p>"

Wealth of knowledge and wider industry experience.<\/h3><p>You need to remind yourself that <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=whathowfuture\" title=\"\">Design Subscription providers<\/a> are not limited to providing to a single industry. We can explore outside an industry, jump from industry to industry, and even span across multiple industries.<\/p><p>Our clients come from a range of different industries, like Fintech, Food and Beverage, and Educational. This enables us to continuously build our design knowledge, experience, and insights.<\/p><p>Thus, the expertise we gain is directly reflected in the quality of work we deliver to you.<\/p><h3>2. Onboard instantly and easily, or <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/book\" title=\"\">book a call to find out more<\/a>?<\/h3><p>We&#039;ve worked on the tools, and we&#039;ve managed teams and products. We&#039;ve also interviewed for new roles and waited a head scratching amount of time for HR and IT to process the paperwork and equipment.<\/p><p>It&#039;s not cool and doesn&#039;t paint a very good picture for your new hire!<\/p><p>That why we&#039;re <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/#anchor-gettingstarted?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=whathowfuture\" title=\"\">ready to start within minutes<\/a> of client sign-up. Onboarding doesn&#039;t need to take up masses of time and effort, so we&#039;ve optimised ours to become a clean and clear onboarding process, which you&#039;ll appreciate.<\/p><p>Upcoming project or campaign. Hello!\nSwamped with a growing backlog. The solution is our subscription.<\/p><p>No paperwork. No employee insurance or pension. Bugger all!<\/p><h3>3. Cancel at any time, with no commitment!<\/h3><p>And just as quick and easily as onboarding, you can cancel your subscription.<\/p><p>If you hit an unusual or unexpected quiet period, just <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/#cancel-my-subscription?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=whathowfuture\" title=\"\">cancel your design subscription<\/a>. If the backlog has cleared, <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/#cancel-my-subscription?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=whathowfuture\" title=\"\">cancel your development subscription<\/a>. No questions asked!<\/p><h3>4. No pay review or bonus. Just a single fixed monthly cost!<\/h3><p>It&#039;s the same <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/#anchor-designplans?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=whathowfuture\" title=\"\">single fixed cost<\/a> for each active month, removing all the overhead costs.<\/p><ul><li><p>No promotions.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No bonuses.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No pensions.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No company car.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No gym memberships.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No private healthcare.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No annual events.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No discount cards.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No parental leave.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No sick leave.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No equipment.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No software.<\/p><\/li><li><p>No training.<\/p><\/li><\/ul><p><em>[...you get the point]<\/em><\/p><p>As much as we enjoy 1:1 meetings, spending 80% of that time talking about stuff that isn&#039;t related to progression. We&#039;d prefer to spend our time on what provides value and makes an impact for you.<\/p><p>Drip Fed Design has been <a href=\"https:\/\/dripfed.design\/#just-employ-a-designer?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=whathowfuture\" title=\"\">designed and built to save you time, overhead costs, and increase ROI<\/a>.<\/p><h3>5.

Transferable loyalty and satisfaction, that can follow you around.<\/h3><p>Everyone should have strong relationships they can stick with, trust, and know they can fall back onto.

        "articleBody": "<p>When it comes to digital marketing, yeah ok not all brands fail to implement A\/B testing, but a lot do. A lot of marketeers say they don&#039;t have time, we leave everything to an agency, or admit it&#039;s just lack-of understanding and implementation.<\/p><blockquote><p><em>Marketeer: &quot;Great, but why should I care?&quot;<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote><p>Because it&#039;s what could make the difference between a good campaign, or a excellent one.<\/p><p>So, what&#039;s there to take advantage of with A\/B testing in the digital marketing space.

This might involve testing different user journeys, buttons, copy, images, or other areas.<\/p><h2>6. Optimise Marketing Spend<\/h2><p>By testing and understanding what works best, brands can assign budget to what&#039;s valuable, a higher return on investment.<\/p><h2>7.

ALWAYS Test &amp; Share<\/strong><\/h2><p>Testing and sharing what&#039;s learnt can create a culture of experimentation and innovation within a business. By always testing, brands can stay ahead of marketing trends, competitors, and change in audience behaviour.<\/p><p>Furthermore, keep a historic view on how audience behaviour changes over time.
